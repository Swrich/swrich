I'm [Your Name], a developer from [Your Location] who likes to write code, drink coffee ☕️, and pet cats 🐱.

🔭 I’m currently working on
Building a time machine using React and Node.js (just kidding 🤣, I'm actually working on a new web app for a client).
🌱 I’m currently learning
How to play guitar 🎸 (I'm not very good yet 🙈).
The art of making a perfect latte ☕️.
📫 How to reach me
Email: I have no email.
😄 Pronouns
He/Him (unless you prefer something else, I'm not picky 🤷‍♂️).
⚡ Fun fact
I once ate 100 chicken nuggets in one sitting (I don't recommend it 🤢).
Feel free to check out my portfolio for more information about me and my projects, or just to see some cool cat pics 🐱.
